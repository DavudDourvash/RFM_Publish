## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the initial code, notebooks, and datasets for performing **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) on transactional data.

The goal of the project is to analyze user/customer behavior based on historical orders or transactions and prepare RFM-based metrics that can later be used for:
- Customer segmentation
- Behavioral monitoring
- Reporting and dashboard publishing (e.g., BI tools)

## 📊 What is RFM Analysis?

RFM is a widely used behavioral analysis technique based on three dimensions:

- **Recency** – How recently a user made a transaction  
- **Frequency** – How often a user transacts  
- **Monetary** – How much value a user generates  

These metrics help identify valuable users, inactive users, and users at risk of churn.
